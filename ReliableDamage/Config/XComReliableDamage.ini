; XCOM has a "PlusOne" mechanic. Certain weapons such as the Pistol have a > 0% chance to do +1 damage. 
; The value of the weapon's PlusOne stat determines the chance this occurs.
; We will remove this randomness and simply add the expected value of PlusOne to each shot. 
; Set to 0 to revert to default XCOM behavior.
